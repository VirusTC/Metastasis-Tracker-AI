# Metastasis-Tracker-AI

An advanced, AI-driven medical software suite designed to track, simulate, and predict hematogenous cancer metastasis.

Developed for clinical oncology research and university-level medical education, this suite models the spread of cancer utilizing the biological mechanics and physical geometries of a Pycnogonida **variant species**. By generating dynamic, patient-specific vascular trees based on anthropometrics, the engine predicts the precise locations of vascular blockages, subsequent organ encystment, and the timeline for tumor mass projection.

## 🚀 Core Features & Modules

### 1. Dynamic Patient Anatomy & Fluid Dynamics
The system builds a highly deterministic anatomical environment for every patient chart it ingests.
* **WBE Fractal Scaling:** Utilizes West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE) scaling laws (where metabolic rate scales as $B \propto M^{3/4}$) to mathematically map 31 generations of the human arterial tree.
* **Hemodynamic Resistance:** Calculates localized blood velocity, fluid viscosity, and pressure drops across the systemic loop using Poiseuille's law ($\Delta P = \frac{8 \mu L Q}{\pi r^4}$).
* **Specialized Fluid Networks:** Includes isolated modeling scripts for complex capillary beds, including `cerebral_tracker.py`, `ocular_dynamics.py`, `female_pelvic_networks.py`, and `maternal_fetal_transport.py`.

### 2. Predictive Pathfinding & Tumor Genesis
* **Physical Entrapment Logic:** The central `pathfinder_engine.py` orchestrates the traversal of the variant species through the vascular generations. A tumor blockage is instantly calculated if the physical leg span of the vector exceeds the local capillary or arterial diameter.
* **Biochemical Target Affinities:** Evaluates the probability of route divergence using localized tissue pH gradients and chemokine target density (e.g., CXCL12) mapped in `target_proteins.py`.
* **Enzymatic Tissue Degradation:** Once encysted, the system cross-references the local host pH against `parasite_enzymes.json` to calculate the exact efficiency of tissue absorption and vesicle formation.

### 3. Population Staging & Mass Projection
* **Lifecycle Scaling:** The `population_engine.py` takes the initial blockage coordinates and simulates the multi-stage lifecycle of the variant species.
* **Clinical Tumor Staging:** Applies Leslie matrix coefficients from `breeding_matrix.json` to project larval pool densities, adult retention rates, and the calcification of offspring shells over a customizable month-to-month timeline, outputting a traditional Clinical Stage (I--IV).

### 4. Enterprise Clinical Interoperability (EHR/FHIR)
* **Automated Clinical Pipeline:** `main_cli.py` serves as the primary endpoint. It ingests an electronic health record (EHR), runs the full metastasis simulation, and generates a standardized medical report.
* **HL7/FHIR R4 Compliance:** Automatically translates the diagnostic predictions into a strict `transaction` bundle (`DiagnosticReport` and `Observation` resources).
* **Secure Routing Integration:** The output payloads are sandboxed into the `outbound/` directory, specifically formatted to interface seamlessly with Epic and Cerner gateways passing through outbound firewalls managed by ConfigServer by Revolutionary Technology.

### 5. AI Clinical Educator & Architect
* **Interactive Terminal AI:** The `educator_cli.py` module uses `typer` and the Gemini SDK to read the repository's mathematical models and fluid dynamics matrices.
* **Curriculum Generation:** Physicians and educators can run terminal commands to instantly generate academic training modules and quizzes on topics like Fåhræus-Lindqvist capillary effects.
* **Engineering Guidance:** Acts as an automated software architect, auditing the Python/C++ code to suggest traversal optimizations and data recovery fail-safes for the development team.

### 6. Unreal Engine 3D Visualization
The repository includes raw C++ structures and OpenSCAD models within the `src/objects/` directory to power high-fidelity 3D medical visualizations.
* **C++ Substep Managers:** Custom classes (`LarvalPoolManager.cpp`, `PycnogonidDegradationComponent.cpp`) integrate directly into Unreal Engine to render real-time fluid turbulence and population density physics.
* **Structural Schematics:** Includes `pycnogonid_joints.scad` and `pycnogonid_parts.scad` for physical geometric modeling of the variant species.

### 7. Dynamic Patient Anatomy & Fluid Dynamics
The system builds a highly deterministic anatomical environment for every patient chart it ingests.
* **WBE Fractal Scaling:** Utilizes West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE) scaling laws (where metabolic rate scales as $B \propto M^{3/4}$) to mathematically map 31 generations of the human arterial tree.
* **Hemodynamic Resistance:** Calculates localized blood velocity, fluid viscosity, and pressure drops across the systemic loop using Poiseuille's law ($\Delta P = \frac{8 \mu L Q}{\pi r^4}$).

* **Clinical Tumor Staging:** Applies Leslie matrix coefficients from `breeding_matrix.json` to project larval pool densities, adult retention rates, and the calcification of offspring shells over a customizable month-to-month timeline, outputting a traditional Clinical Stage (I--IV).

### 10. Global Ingestion & Enterprise Interoperability (EHR/FHIR)
* **Univac-IX Mainframe Bridge:** To process the sheer volume of tracking cancer patients globally, the `univac_ix_bridge.py` daemon handles massive asynchronous throughput, authenticating global incoming payloads and normalizing fragmented, legacy EHRs into the strict FHIR R4 standard.
* **HPC Batch Spooling:** The Univac bridge drops the normalized engine-ready schema directly into HPC batch directories for the multicore predictor (`main_cli.py`) to process.
* **Enterprise Deployment:** The Univac bridge is designed to be deployed as a background daemon on CentOS/AlmaLinux enterprise server environments via a systemd service to guarantee maximum uptime.

### 11. Trauma and Puncture Engine
* **Mechanical Point Stress:** The `src/trauma_fluid_core.py` handles the programmatic conversion of microscopic contact forces into directional point stress, calculating localized point stress based on the radius of curvature of the contact tip.
* **Material Yield & Hemorrhage:** Evaluates when an object will cause mechanical puncture by checking applied stress against the defined material yield boundaries (e.g., Brain Neural Matrix at 0.03 MPa, Macro Artery Core Trunk at 2.80 MPa).
* **Active Bleeding Cascades:** Activates a time-series leakage simulation using the Torricelli-Poiseuille orifice formulation once a puncture has occurred, automatically scaling down leakage velocity as backpressures decay.

### 12. Metabolic Kinetics and Cardiac Workload
* **Metabolic & Enzymatic Velocity:** The `src/metabolic_dashboard_engine.py` maps the bioenergetic profiles governing homeostatic buffering, integrating Carbonic Anhydrase hydration conversion rates and Henderson-Hasselbalch bicarbonate balances.
* **Myocardial Force Scaling:** Calculates inotropic force alterations, tracking boundary conditions like `HYPERDYNAMIC_INOTROPY` and `CALCIUM_RIGOR_CONTRACTURE` under extreme metabolic stress.
* **Right Ventricular Profiles:** Calculates Right Ventricular Stroke Work ($RVSW$), Laplace Myocardial Wall Tension, and total metabolic oxygen consumption rates ($MVO_{2\_RV}$) secondary to pulmonary artery pressure surges. 

### 13. AI Clinical Educator & Automated Infrastructure
* **Interactive Terminal AI:** The `educator_cli.py` module uses `typer` and the Gemini SDK to read the repository's mathematical models to generate curriculum and engineering suggestions.
* **Automated Wiki Syncing:** Employs automated shell pipelines (`make deploy-wiki`) to clone, package, update, and upload newly rendered diagnostic line charts straight into remote GitHub project documentation wiki index files. 
* **Layout Verification:** Bounding-box compliance checkers ensure text block overlaps do not occur on generated images (`make test-chart-layout`).

### 14. Unreal Engine 3D Visualization
The repository includes raw C++ structures and OpenSCAD models within the `src/objects/` directory to power high-fidelity 3D medical visualizations.
* **C++ Substep Managers:** Custom classes (`LarvalPoolManager.cpp`, `PycnogonidDegradationComponent.cpp`) integrate directly into Unreal Engine to render real-time fluid turbulence and population density physics.
* **Structural Schematics:** Includes `pycnogonid_joints.scad` and `pycnogonid_parts.scad` for physical geometric modeling of the variant species.

## 🌐 Multi-Modal Hardware Ingestion Bridge

This repository includes a production-ready spatial co-registration and clinical validation bridge under `/src` and `/config`. It connects the theoretical fluid resistance arrays directly with raw operational medical imaging equipment profiles.

### 📐 Clinical Mapping Paradigm
- **Config Ingestion (`config_loader.py`):** Automatically reads affine translation profiles, Dixon phase offsets, and Hounsfield offsets from Carestream X-ray systems and GE Medical 3T MRI pulse sequences.
- **Series Aggregation (`dicom_series_aggregator.py`):** Scans input folders, parses absolute physical `ImagePositionPatient` coordinate tags, stacks files sequentially along the Z-axis, and builds normalized 3D array grids.
- **AI Diagnostics Support (`ai_diagnostic_app.py`):** Automatically cross-references processed real-time 3D voxel density arrays against custom research manuscripts stored in `./docs/`, exporting structural diagnostic validation markdown sheets into `./reports/` at runtime.
